# Banking Application

## Introduction
By leveraging Java 8, I developed an application that simulates simple banking transactions through the termianl/console. User's of the application can access the applicaiton by downloading the source code and running the program locally. The program only takes input from the terminal and displays output from the terminal.

## Banking Applicaiton Functionality
*	Built the application using Java 8
*	All interaction with the user is done through the console using the `Scanner` class
*	Customers of the bank are able to register with a username and password, and apply to open an account. 
*	Customers are able to apply for joint accounts

*	Once the account is open, customers are able to withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds between accounts
    * All basic validation is done, such as trying to input negative amounts, overdrawing from accounts etc.
    
*	Employees of the bank are able to view all of their customers information. This includes:
    * Account information
    * Account balances
    * Personal information
    
*	Employees are able to approve/deny open applications for accounts

*	Bank admins are able to view and edit all accounts. This includes:
    * Approving/denying accounts
    * withdrawing, depositing, transferring from all accounts
    * canceling accounts
    
*	Reasonable test coveragg was conducted using JUnit.
    * TDD is encouraged.
    
*	Logging is accomplished using Log4J
    * All transactions should be logged
